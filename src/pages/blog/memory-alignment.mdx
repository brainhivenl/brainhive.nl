    Today we're going to talk about memory alignment.
    We'll show some practical examples in Rust to show why this is relevant.
---

Before we dive into it, let's start with a practical example in Rust to show why this is relevant:

```rust
use std::mem;

struct Member {
    active: bool,
    age: i32,
}

fn main() {
    println!("bool: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<bool>());
    println!("i32: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<i32>());
    println!("Member: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<Member>());
}
```

We defined a struct called `Member`, which includes two fields.
Then we print the memory size of all of the types.
The size of a bool in rust is 1 byte, and the size of a 32-bit integer is 4 bytes; thus, the total size of our struct should be 5 bytes, right?

```bash
➜ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/memory-alignment`
bool: 1 bytes
i32: 4 bytes
Member: 8 bytes
```

What kind of dark magic is this... Where do these extra three bytes come from?

## CPU and memory

To understand how this works, we need to understand how the CPU reads the memory.
The CPU sends the address of the memory it wants to read to the address bus.
Then it sends the “read” command to the memory on the control bus, and finally, the memory will send the data to the data bus.

The amount of data transferred is often the same size as a single word (a unit specific for processors).
On most 64-bit CPUs, the word size equals 8 bytes (=64 bits), whereas, on most 32-bit CPUs, this would be 4 bytes (=32 bits).
Unaligned memory usually hurts performance as more CPU instructions are required.
This is where memory alignment comes into place.

## Back to our code

Remember that our `Member` struct has a size of 8 bytes while its fields combined only take up 5 bytes?
This is because the compiler automatically aligns our memory.
To do so, it adds three extra bytes of padding.

![Memory layout of our struct on x86_64](/posts/memory-alignment/member-struct.png)

The amount of padding is based on the field type, struct size, and CPU properties (such as the word size).

## Field order

The order of the fields in C, C++, Go, and possible other programming languages matter because extra padding will be used.
However, in Rust, struct fields will be re-ordered by default to get the smallest possible size.
The compiler is allowed to do so because, by default, Rust [makes no guarantees](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation) for struct types.

To demonstrate, we can use the C representation, which will use a type layout interoperable with the C Language.
Let's add another boolean field to our struct:

```rust
use std::mem;

#[repr(C)]
struct Member {
    active: bool,
    age: i32,
    admin: bool,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Member: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<Member>());
}
```

The `repr(C)` attribute enables the C representation. This way, the fields won't be re-ordered. Let’s execute it to see the result:

```bash
➜ cargo run
   Compiling memory-alignment v0.1.0 
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/memory-alignment`
Member: 12 bytes
```

We can now “optimize” our `Member` struct by re-ordering the fields manually.
To get the memory size back to 8 bytes, we have to move the `age` field to be the first field in the struct:

```rust
use std::mem;

#[repr(C)]
struct Member {
    age: i32,
    active: bool,
    admin: bool,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Member: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<Member>());
}
```

To verify if this has the expected result, we need to execute our program again:

```bash
➜ cargo run
   Compiling memory-alignment v0.1.0 
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
     Running `target/debug/memory-alignment`
Member: 8 bytes
```

To understand how this works, we can look at the memory layout for our `Member` struct both before and after re-ordering the fields.

## Tooling

As mentioned earlier, tooling is unnecessary when using Rust, as you most likely don't have to manually re-order fields.
However, when you use Go, you can configure the [fieldalignment analyzer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment) with [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) to warn about “unoptimized” structures.

I’m not aware of any tooling for C or C++ so let me know if you have any suggestions!
